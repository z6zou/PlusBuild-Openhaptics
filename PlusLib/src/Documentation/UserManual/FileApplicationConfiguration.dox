/**

\page FileApplicationConfiguration Application configuration file

Some settings can be set commonly for all applications and device set configurations,
such as directories, last used device set, and preferred text editor application.
These settings are described in the <em>application configuration file</em>.

The application configuration file name is PlusConfig.xml and it is loaded from the directory where the executable file is located. If the file does not exist, the application creates one with the default values.

The application configuration file is an XML file with the following root element:
- \xmlElem \b PlusConfig
  - \xmlAtt \b LogLevel Logging level. See more information on the \subpage FileLog page.
    - \c 1 (ERROR) Only errors are logged
    - \c 2 (WARNING) Only errors and warnings are logged
    - \c 3 (DEBUG) Errors, warnings, and debugging information are logged. Useful for developers and troubleshooting.
    - \c 4 (TRACE) Errors, warnings, and detailed debugging information are logged. Large amount of data may be generated, even if the application is idle. Useful for developers and troubleshooting.
  - \xmlAtt \b DeviceSetConfigurationDirectory Device set configuration files will be searched relative to this directory (if an absolute path is defined then this directory is ignored).
  - \xmlAtt \b ImageDirectory Sequence metafiles (.mha, .mhd files) will be searched relative to this directory.
  - \xmlAtt \b ModelDirectory Model files (.stl files) will be searched relative to this directory.
  - \xmlAtt \b ScriptsDirectory Directory of scripts that application may need.
